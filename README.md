# odin-recipes
First HTML Project
This will be a basic project on using the HTML skills learned in the TOP Foundations course.
We will create a webite on recipes. This will be ugly, atleast to start with and will be tiuedied up with CSS when I ge tthat far. 

Ill return here to point out what was hard and what I wish I had done differently when its all finished.
