    <p>These are the American style hotcakes traditionally served with maple syrup and banana but you could sneak in a bit of bacon for some extra sustenance!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups Edmonds standard grade flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp Edmonds baking powder</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup Chelsea white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups Meadow Fresh milk, approximately</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl.</li>
        <li>In another bowl beat the eggs and sugar with a whisk until pale and thick.</li>
        <li>Add the egg mixture and the milk to the dry ingredients and mix until just combined.</li>
        <li>Gently heat a non-stick frying pan and drop large spoonfuls of the mixture from the point of the spoon onto the surface.</li>
        <li>When bubbles start to burst on the top of the pikelets, turn them over and cook the second side until golden. Place in a clean tea towel to keep warm until they are all ready to serve.</li>   
    </ol>
