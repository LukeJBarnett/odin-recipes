            <p>Lasagne made just like it should be, with layers of pasta and homemade meat sauce</p>
           <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Tbsp Olive oil</li>
            <li>1 Chopped onion</li>
            <li>1 clove Crushed garlic</li>
            <li>500 g Beef mince</li>
            <li>I cant be bothered writing the rest</li>
        </ul>
           <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1.</strong> Oil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 2-3 minutes or until softened. Add beef mince and cook for 5 minutes or until browned, breaking up any large pieces.</li>
            <li><strong>2.</strong> Add tomatoes, Leggo's Tomato Paste, stock and herbs, including bay leaf. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove bay leaf.</li>
            <li><strong>3.</strong> To make cheese sauce: Melt butter in a saucepan, add flour and stir continuously for 1-2 minutes without browning. Remove from heat and gradually stir in milk. Bring to the boil stirring continuously until sauce thickens. Add cheese and stir until cheese melts.</li>
            <li><strong>4.</strong> Grease a 25 x 30cm baking dish. Cover with a layer of lasagne, spread with a 1/3 of the meat sauce and sprinkle with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat to make 2 more layers. Finish with a layer of lasagne sheets. Pour cheese sauce over the top.</li>
            <li><strong>5.</strong> Cover with foil and bake in a preheated oven at 180Â°C for 20 minutes, remove foil and cook a further 10 minutes or until heated through and cheese sauce is a light golden brown.</li>
            <li><strong>TIP:</strong> Sprinkle with extra mozzarella cheese over the cheese sauce in STEP 4 for an extra cheesy top.</li>
        </ul>
